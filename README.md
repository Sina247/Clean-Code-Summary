## 🧪 Chapter 8: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Three TDD rules:**

- ❌ Write a failing test first  
- 📝 Write minimal code to fail the test  
- ✅ Write the simplest code to pass the test  

**Benefits:**

- ✔️ Confidence in code behavior  
- 🐛 Fewer bugs  
- 💪 Courage to refactor  
- 📄 Live documentation  
- 🎨 Cleaner design  

**Professional tips:**

- ⚡ Keep tests fast and isolated  
- 🛠️ Mock external dependencies  
- 🔄 Refactor after tests pass  
- 🎯 Focus on edge cases first

## 🥋 Chapter 9: Practice and Skill Drills

- 🥋 **Kata:** individual practice to refine skills  
- 🤝 **Wasa:** two-person practice for feedback and paired learning  
- 🔄 **Randori:** free-style practice simulating real-world complexity  
- 💡 Tip: Consistent practice is more effective than occasional long sessions

## 🔑 Core Clean Code Principles

- 📝 **Meaningful Names:** variables, functions, classes should clearly indicate intent  
- ✂️ **Small Functions with Single Responsibility:** each function should do only one thing and be short  
- 🎯 **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** each class or function should have only one reason to change  
- 🔄 **DRY:** Don’t repeat yourself  
- 🧩 **KISS:** Keep code simple, not clever  
- 🚫 **YAGNI:** Only write what you need now; avoid unnecessary features  
- 👀 **Readability > Cleverness:** code should be understandable by others and yourself in the future  
- 📏 **Consistent Formatting:** maintain indentation, spacing, blank lines, and bracket placement  
- 🛠️ **Continuous Refactoring:** improve code regularly even when it works  
- 🧪 **Test-Driven Thinking:** write tests first, design code for easy testing
